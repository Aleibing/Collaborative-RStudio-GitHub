# Observe the merged contributions

***

**If the session is live**:  check to see your collaborator's response to your request. Most likely it will be a thumbs up and result in a merge! But your collaborator might also request a correction if they spot an error. 

**If you are following this tutorial on your own**: you can see a recording of the merge on GitHub here: 



1. **Collaborator's screen**: Once all parameters are collated, look out for the results on your collaborator/instructor's screen. After inspecting and accepting your pull requests (in the pull request tab in their GitHub repository), they will pull their GitHub repository into their local repository.

2. **Collaborator's screen**: They will knit the Rmarkdown file `plot-trait-evolution.Rmd` which sources all the contributed files. Knitting a Rmarkdown file means rendering the Rmarkdown code (that integrate R code and Markdown code) into a defined format, here a html file. This file generates plots and figures based on the parameters that were contributed.

3. **Collaborator's screen**: If all packages needed to run this script and to knit the file into a html page are installed, this file will generate plots and figures based on the parameters that were contributed.
